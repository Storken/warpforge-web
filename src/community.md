## Chat

Weâ€™re in Matrix, [join our channel](https://matrix.to/#/#warpforge:matrix.org)!

We have previously also been in IRC, which was accessible via [https://web.libera.chat/gamja/#warpforge](https://web.libera.chat/gamja/#warpforge). â€” however, this is discontinued ðŸ˜ž, we found that the bridging to Matrix was too unstable and worrying about what got replicated to IRC caused us to give up too many features, so weâ€™ve retreated from IRC for now.

## Project repos

Youâ€™ve probably already seen the repo link:

[**https://github.com/warptools/warpforge**](https://github.com/warptools/warpforge)

And the Warptools org on github overall contains Warpforge and related tools and repo:

[warptools](https://github.com/warptools/)

There are also repos for the default catalog of releases, and for the scripts that made them:

[https://github.com/warpsys/catalog](https://github.com/warpsys/catalog)

[https://github.com/warpsys/warpsys](https://github.com/warpsys/warpsys)

Github issues are fine.  PRs are welcome too (although you probably want to discuss the plan first in either chat or issues, before writing a ton of code).

Youâ€™ll have to use your best judgement for which repo to open issues on.  If in doubt, on warpforge is probably the best default choice.  (Or, ask in chat, and see if someone can give you a pointer!)

## Notion

You can join us in editing things here on Notion, too!

Get in touch with a core contributor and ask if they can add you as an editor.

(Sidenote, though: Please *donâ€™t* try to use Notionâ€™s notifications for communication.  Theyâ€™re incredibly janky.  Even if using comments, itâ€™s still a much better idea to send direct messages to folks on other platforms to make sure theyâ€™ve actually seen anything that needs attention.)

## Contributor's Guide

â€¦has it's own page!

## Ecosystem

If youâ€™re a user of Warpforge at all, youâ€™re part of the community!

Let us know if youâ€™ve used Warpforge to build stuff, or if you have release catalogs youâ€™d like to share more broadly!

Weâ€™d be happy to link to what youâ€™ve built, so other people can see it, enjoy it, and riff off your success.

Weâ€™re also quite happy to start accepting release and replay data into the catalog weâ€™re maintaining.  (Automation for this might not be quite here yet, but nonetheless!)

## Email

Hello, oldschool friend!

We donâ€™t have a mailing list.  (Yet?)

`hash@exultant.us` is most definitely going to get you a human being, though.
