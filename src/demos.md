## Demo videos

Here’s some nice videos of `warpforge` doing its thing:

- Using the quickstart and writing a module:
    
    [Warpforge Quickstart Demo](https://asciinema.org/a/ax3iU4aRu17Cx4CG1OYBNCPb6)
    
- Adding content to a catalog from the web:
    
    [Plot Demo](https://asciinema.org/a/XL03vvethmuqnA1iNJx2xDsRD)
    
- Compute using hashes — this is the low-level API on display:
    
    [Formula Demo](https://asciinema.org/a/FY4iYhlEi5m0h78oFYqqvIZYc)
    
- Awk in a box!  This is what it looks like to combine a tool and a dataset (think: reproducible scientific compute, or distributable bigdata jobs):

You can also find lots of complete examples in the [examples directory](https://github.com/warpfork/warpforge/tree/master/examples) of the project repo — check ‘em out!

### Real world software

You can find usable demos of some much less trivial software, built entirely using the Warpsys packaging style (e.g., completely self-contained portable bundles, using the[Warpsys Dynamic Library Linking Strategy](https://www.notion.so/Warpsys-Dynamic-Library-Linking-Strategy-65f91fbd20c349eab8352f4c303445dc), etc), released in [catalog.warpsys.org](http://catalog.warpsys.org) .

For example, you can find packages of software such as Bash, Python, Emacs, Helix, and many more there.

We don’t have recordings of these at present, but you can try it for yourself easily :)

## Real Catalogs

The public catalog we maintain — and the one warpforge will fetch by default — is here:

[**https://github.com/warpsys/catalog**](https://github.com/warpsys/catalog)

This is rendered as navigable HTML here:

## Real Workspaces

The scripts that build the stuff in the public catalog are all here:

[**https://github.com/warpsys/warpsys**](https://github.com/warpsys/warpsys)

These are a “workspace” (there’s lots of “modules” in there).

## Talks and Presentations

### GPN2022

Warpforge was presented at GPN20 (which is in 2022).
